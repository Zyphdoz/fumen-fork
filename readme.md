A slightly modified copy of https://fumen.zui.jp/ which can be used locally.

Modifications:
- `english.js`, `greyout.js`, `mirror.js`, `frame.js`, `listing.js` and `pfcode.js` add ons are loaded automatically. 
- removed the add-on button and made the addon UI always visible.
- if Auto Output is checked, it will also auto update the pfcode diagram automatically.
- added button for copying pfcode diagram to clipboard.
